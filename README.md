Module 17 Challenge Credit Risk Analysis for Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk

## Overview of the analysis: 
This exercise was to apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge of credit card risk.  I employed different techniques  to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.  There were a total of six algorithms used to evaluate the data given 
- Random Oversampling using `RandomOverSampler`
- Oversampling usint `SMOTE`
- Undersampling using `ClusterCentroids`
- Combination of over- and undersampling using `SMOTEEN`
- Ensemble Classifier `BalancedRandomForestClassifier`
- Ensemble Classifier `EasyEnsembleClassifier`
